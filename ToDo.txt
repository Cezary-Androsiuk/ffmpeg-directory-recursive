1. change in, out and move paths displayed in command prompt and in FFOFile to relative with inDirectory (add setter for inDirectory to FFExecute)
 - add inDirectory to FFOFile
 - at the end add info about inDirectory example: "Finished all FFmpegs in [inDirectory]!"

2. add possibility to run ffmpegRec while ffmpeg and source files directories already exist
 - analyze content of the directories
    - check if in ffmpeg dir none file colidate with files in inDirectory
       - if any match, check if is valid, if not and inDirectory file is valid, then can be replaced
    - check if all files in source files directory match with those in ffmpeg directory (and vice versa)
    - you know... do the smart stuff 
       - i mean, prove that, the ffmpeg and source files directories are not leftovers from previous compresion, are not a random names
       - helpfull might be thinking that user want to continue the compresion (due to Ctrl+C or random malfunction) or that user added some new files to inDirectory (during the previous compression)

3. add more advanced protection to the "disconected disk" case
 - if inDirectory failed and cannot be found, 
    - start a loop that refreshes every x seconds and checks if inDirectory exist
    - if directory suddenly appear wait y seconds, remove previous outFile (if exist) and retry the same file compression that failed

8. separate currently compressed FFOFile output from the rest to the temporary one and after finished compression of the file, trim data from the temporary and move it to main FFOFile (main but in range of one compression)

9. fix compressing FFOFile - now is even larger thanks to the new pipe handling method (-progress flag)

10. add 5th argument for output directory postfix, "-ffmpeg-h.265" could be confusing when command was changed
   - by default postfix is "-ffmpeg-h.265"
   - if ffmpeg core was changed by user (and the 5th argument was not provided), then use postfix "-ffmpeg" 
   - but if user is interested in other naming style, then he can specify the 5th argument

11. after 100% correct ("In meantime, no other errors occured") execution check if in source directory any files are left
   - if no (is empty or only folders) then delete it recursively
12. decide what to do with finished source files folder and stick with it - deleting it by hand is repeatable, but leaving it for user is also good idea (he will by default move them to trash instead of hard deleting)

13. output file extension can be also added as an argument (6th at this point), now by default is mp4
   - in addition, if user sets argument as "", then output extension will match input file extension
