1. change in, out and move paths displayed in command prompt and in FFOFile to relative with inDirectory (add setter for inDirectory to FFExecute)
 - add inDirectory to FFOFile
 - at the end add info about inDirectory example: "Finished all FFmpegs in [inDirectory]!"

2. add possibility to run ffmpegRec while ffmpeg and source files directories already exist
 - analyze content of the directories
    - check if in ffmpeg dir none file colidate with files in inDirectory
       - if any match, check if is valid, if not and inDirectory file is valid, then can be replaced
    - check if all files in source files directory match with those in ffmpeg directory (and vice versa)
    - you know... do the smart stuff 
       - i mean, prove that, the ffmpeg and source files directories are not leftovers from previous compresion, are not a random names
       - helpfull might be thinking that user want to continue the compresion (due to Ctrl+C or random malfunction) or that user added some new files to inDirectory (during the previous compression)

3. add more advanced protection to the "disconected disk" case
 - if inDirectory failed and cannot be found, 
    - start a loop that refreshes every x seconds and checks if inDirectory exist
    - if directory suddenly appear wait y seconds, remove previous outFile (if exist) and retry the same file compression that failed

4. remove old flexible argument function and add new with extensions mp4+mkv+m4a+mov+avi

5. fix invalid agruments info text

6. fix Ctrl+C not deleting files

7. move FFOFile to (maybe all - not only created by current compression (in case if prevoius execution fail or something) ) ffmpeg directory

8. separate currently compressed FFOFile output from the rest to the temporary one and after finished compression of the file, trim data from the temporary and move it to main FFOFile (main but in range of one compression)
